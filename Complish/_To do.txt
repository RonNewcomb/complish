
DECISION: Imperative function bodies end at the first statement that isn't imperative. 

I'd like a "parenthetical aside" to define stuff mid-function, perhaps leaving room for anonymous functions. Since there's no way to explicitly state a function has ended. 

DECISION: Global variables: turn them into implicitly passed & returned arguments through the functions that need them. 

Add enums, bools. 

Relative clauses parse fine, but add them as a separate line preceding their use, putting the result into a temp var. (auto-named, even if not human-readable name) 

Scope issue with temporal constraints.  How does it work?  For now assume global?  It shouldn't add anything to scope, just check that the clauses are valid... somehow.

Would like to unify symbol-definition ("is" statements) with the rest of the system, as if new-symbol was a Type. Makes "mynamespace begins here" possible.

Higher order functions. 

Partially-applied functions.

IDEA: use paF (partially applied functions) to implemente temporal constraints only because a paF allows determinate & indeterminate NPs to mix.

Can gerund phrases nest? Should they? To find where a gerund's signature ends and the outer function's signature begins again, 
	we use an example: if the gerund verb is Xing, then look for all functions To X and it should match one of them.

NEXT STEPS: 
	invoke a higher-order function, type-safely
	move the special-case "is it a gerund" code from the leaf functions to.. a common place more suited? 
		(The issue is a gerund phrase is an aNP, and aNP are supposed to go there. )
